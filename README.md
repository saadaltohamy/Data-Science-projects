# Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of data science projects, each organized in its own folder. Below is a description of each project and a summary of its purpose and contents.

## 1. Car Price Prediction
**Folder:** `Car Price Prediction/`

- **car_price.ipynb**: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook that walks through the process of predicting car prices. The notebook covers data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and the application of various machine learning models (including KNN, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest, Stacking, and more) to predict car prices. It includes detailed steps for handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables, as well as model evaluation and comparison.
- **train.csv**: The training dataset containing car features and prices used for model training and validation.
- **test.csv**: The test dataset used for evaluating model performance and making final predictions.

## 2. Candy Data Cleaning
**Folder:** `Candy Data Cleaning/`

- **Candy Template.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook focused on cleaning and analyzing candy survey data. The notebook likely includes steps for data preprocessing, handling missing values, and basic exploratory analysis.
- **candyhierarchy2017.csv**: The main dataset containing survey responses about various candies from 2017.
- **candyhierarchy2017.xlsx**: An Excel version of the candy survey dataset.
- **candyhierarchy.pdf**: A PDF document, possibly containing the survey questions or additional information about the dataset.

## 3. Data analysis
**Folder:** `Data analysis/`

- **visualization.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook for data visualization, likely using the `supermarket_sales.csv` dataset.
- **supermarket_sales.csv**: A dataset containing sales data from a supermarket, used for analysis and visualization in the notebook.

## 4. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
**Folder:** `EDA/`

- **visualization.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization, using the `airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv` dataset.
- **airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv**: A dataset containing information about airline passenger satisfaction, used for EDA in the notebook.

## 5. Web Scrapping
**Folder:** `Web Scrapping/`

- **web_scrapping.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating web scraping techniques to collect job data.
- **jobs.csv**: The resulting dataset containing job listings or related information, obtained through web scraping.
